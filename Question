Recall a Red-Black Tree is a special form of a binary Tree.

Refer to Redâ€“black tree - Wikipedia for details.

The Red-Black Tree will be used to encode the number of word occurrences within a document.

You may select any text document you like to test your code.

You must implement the following class methods;

7.  A method to remove a word from the tree.

8.  A method to save the tree to a file for recall/reuse in JSON format.

You should instantiate your class in a main module for operation.

Please submit your python modules, the text file, the JSON file for the tree.  In addition please submit a screen shot of your application in operation.

Extra Credit - Fully working and demonstrated application will result in awarding of an additional 100 pts.
